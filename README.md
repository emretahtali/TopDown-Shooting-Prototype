this is a topdown shooting game prototype i've made in 2018 when i was new to game developing.

it's made in GameMaker Studio 2.

since i'd been plannig this to be a rouge-like game, there is a map on the top-left corner that is randomised on every restart.

there is only one room in this protototype. in it, there is one idle enemy, and one patrolling enemy.

controls:

E - pick up gun

WASD - move

Shift - sneak

Q / Left Mouse Button - fire the gun

Ctrl + R - restart the room

Ctrl + G - restart the game

Ctrl + F - fullscreen on/off

Esc - exit the game
